BanateCoreWin32

This is a small library of things related to programming with Windows.

The library uses the LuaJit FFI mechanism as the interop mechanism.

Of particular good usage is the GameWindow.lua class.  This sets up
a simple window that can then be used for many different things.
Eventually, this window will manage a GL Context.

You must use LuaJit - beta 9
